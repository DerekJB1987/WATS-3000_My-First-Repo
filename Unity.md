 # Unity
 ## by Violet Jacob


I dreamed that **life** and **time** and **space** were *one*,
        And the pure trance of dawn;
        The increase drawn
    From all the journeys of the travelling sun,
    And the long mysteries of sound and sight,
        The whispering rains,
    And far, calm waters set in lonely plains,
        And cry of birds at night.
        
I dreamed that these and love and death were **one**,
        And all eternity,
        The life to be
    Therewith entwined, throughout the ages spun;
    And so with **Grief**, my playmate; him I knew
        One with the rest, - 
    One with the mounting day, the east and west - 
        Lord, is it true?
    Lord, do I **dream**? 
    1. Methinks a key unlocks
    1. Some dungeon door, in thrall of blackened towers,
    1. On ecstasies, half hid, like chill white flowers
    1. Blown in the secret places of the rocks.
